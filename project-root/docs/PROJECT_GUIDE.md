## 1) Project overview

### What this project does
- something here

### What this project does NOT do
- something here

---

## 2) High-level architecture

### Canonical source layer (where permanent changes must be made)
- something here

### Artifact / output layer (generated files)
- something here

**Rule: Do not edit artifacts directly. Modify canonical sources and regenerate.**

---

## 3) End-to-end workflows (behavior-first)

### Workflow A: - something here

### Workflow C: - something here
- something here

### Workflow D: - something here
- something here

## 4) Canonical implementations (Single Source of Truth)

### 4.1 - something here

## 5) Generated artifacts vs canonical sources

### Generated artifacts (do NOT edit for permanent changes)
- something here

### Canonical sources (edit here instead)
- something here

---

## 6) Duplication hotspots (AI warnings)
- something here

If asked to change anything in these areas:
1. Check Section 4 first
2. Modify canonical templates/scripts, not individual output files

---

## 7) Safe change playbook

1. Identify which workflow(s) in Section 3 are affected
2. Locate the canonical implementation in Section 4
3. Check at least TWO other potential locations before making changes
4. Modify canonical code **once**
5. Regenerate artifacts if needed
6. Update `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md` if structure or behavior changed
7. Record significant changes in `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`
