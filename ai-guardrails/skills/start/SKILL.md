description: Start a guarded change with a stated goal (do not code yet)
---

If the user did not provide a goal, ask them for the goal in one sentence.

If the user provided a goal, do this:
1) Quote the goal.
2) Read `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`.
3) Restate the goal as behavior (not files).
4) Identify the canonical implementation (or clearly state it doesn’t exist yet).
5) List at least two other locations you checked.
6) Propose a minimal change plan.
Do NOT modify files yet.
